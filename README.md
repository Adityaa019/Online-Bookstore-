# Project Description
BiesStore allows customers to browse and purchase books, while companies can sell their products through the platform. The project consists of three roles: Customer, Company, and Admin. Customers can add products to the shopping cart, view and update the shopping cart, and complete orders via Stripe payment processing. Companies can add product listings, edit or delete existing listings, and manage their orders. Admins have control over the entire operation, including categories, products, and orders.
